# MVP (or ELP)
Minimal Viable or [Earliest Lovable](https://github.com/mrkrumhausen) Product.
For more information on OwnYou, visit the [documentation pages](www.ownyou.io).

There are three components to OwnYou's MVP - an application for the individual user, a publisher SDK and an advertiser SDK.

- The OwnYou consumer application MVP needs to be sufficiently useful that, from its first release, it begs to be shared.
- The OwnYou publisher SDK MVP needs to be so easy to implement, that even the most poorly funded technical team can plug and play it.
- The OwnYou advertiser SDK MVP needs to be so useful, and insightful, that even the most entrenched advertiser will want to use it, and share it.

Each use case needs to be simple as possible.</br>
The MVP establishes a minimum use case per principal stakeholder.</br>
We may choose to mimimic an operational intelligence stack.</br>

Specific MVP requirements can be found in the Projects section but we would encourage you to explore the OwnYou [documentation pages](www.ownyou.io) first.
